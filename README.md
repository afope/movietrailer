# Movie Trailer Website
a program that displays a list of my favourite documentaries, movies, or indie films on a webpage and plays them from youtube.

## Installation
* you must have downloaded python.
* (this program was written in python 2.7)
* [git clone](https://github.com/afope/movietrailer.git)

## Usage
there are three main files, the fresh_tomatoes.py file which helps open up the webpage, the media.py file which initialises the class Movie with the necessary arguments and the entertainment_center.py file which takes in the list of movies. run the entertainment_center.py to see the webpage open up on your browser

## Contribution
i would like to build this into an independent movie website that stores films in its own database and plays the films from its own movie player. and feel free to contribute to the source code.
