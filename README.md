# movie trailer website
a program that displays a list of my favourite documentaries, movies, or indie films on a webpage and plays them from youtube. the project makes use of the following modules by importing them: the *media.py* imports module **webbrowser** while the *entertainment_center.py* imports **fresh_tomatoes** and **media** which are files that make the program work.

## installation
* you must have downloaded python.
* (this program was written in python 2.7)
* to copy the project on your computer, open your terminal and do this: [git clone](https://github.com/afope/movietrailer.git) e.g $ `git clone <remote repo> <repo name>`
* you will find the **remote repo** link above by clicking on the green *"clone or download"* option in tab above the repository
* then run `cd <repo name>` in your terminal ()*<repo name>* is whatever name you gave your repository in the termial)
* this should open up the folder you just cloned from github
* open up your IDLE, which was downloaded in step one above
* in your IDLE, navigate to the folder you just cloned by going to *file* and then clicking *open*
* inside the folder, open the three files, *fresh_tomatoes.py*, *media.py* and *entertainment_center.py*
* in *entertainment_center.py*, this is where you will find the list of movies, click *run* in your IDLE tab, and then from the dropdown menu, click *run module*
* the webpage would open up in your browser

## usage
* there are three main files, the fresh_tomatoes.py file which helps open up the webpage, the media.py file which initialises the class Movie with the necessary arguments and the entertainment_center.py file which takes in the list of movies.
* run the entertainment_center.py to see the webpage open up on your browser

## contribution
i would like to build this into an independent movie website that stores films in its own database and plays the films from its own movie player. and feel free to contribute to the source code.
